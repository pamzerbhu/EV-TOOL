# Build And Flash

The project is PlatformIO-only. Pick the correct board environment in `platformio.ini`, then choose the matching driver and default vehicle mode in your local `platformio_profile.h`.

## Supported PlatformIO Environments

| Env | Board / target | Notes |

| `feather_m4_can` | Adafruit Feather M4 CAN Express | Native CAN build, no web dashboard |
| `esp32_twai` | Generic ESP32 dev board | TWAI dashboard build |
| `lilygo_tcan485_hw3` | LILYGO TCAN485 | TWAI dashboard build with board-specific default pins |
| `m5stack-atomic-can-base` | M5Stack Atom CAN Base | TWAI dashboard build with RGB status LED |
| `m5stack-atoms3-mini-can-base` | M5Stack AtomS3 Mini CAN Base | TWAI dashboard build with RGB status LED and built-in injection toggle button |
| `esp32_feather_v2_mcp2515` | Feather ESP32 V2 + external MCP2515 | Dashboard build using the new MCP2515 driver and web UI |
| `esp32_ext_mcp2515` | ESP32-S3 + external MCP2515 | Dashboard build for SPI MCP2515 hardware |
| `waveshare_ESP32_S3_RS485_CAN` | Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485/CAN | TWAI dashboard build |

## Hardware Notes

Some CAN boards and adapters include an onboard 120 ohm termination resistor. When installing on an existing vehicle CAN bus, do not add another termination point: cut or remove the board's 120 ohm resistor if the adapter has one fitted.

## Selecting Driver, Vehicle, And Defaults

Create your local build config first:

```bash
cp platformio_profile.example.h platformio_profile.h
```

Then edit `platformio_profile.h`:

- choose one driver define
- choose one vehicle define
- set initial hotspot and OTA credentials
- uncomment optional feature defines when you want compile-time defaults changed

`platformio_profile.h` is ignored by git. Keep personal board choices, WiFi credentials, OTA credentials, and gateway keys there. Commit changes to `platformio_profile.example.h` only when you are changing the template for everyone.

You can also use the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/platformio_set_profile.py --driver DRIVER_ESP32_EXT_MCP2515 --vehicle HW4 --enable EMERGENCY_VEHICLE_DETECTION --enable ENHANCED_AUTOPILOT
```

Add `--enable INJECTION_AFTER_AP` when `ENHANCED_AUTOPILOT` should wait until AP is active before mux 1 injection.

For `DRIVER_TWAI` dashboard builds, the helper script intentionally enables all optional feature defines so the dashboard can control those options at runtime; the selected vehicle then becomes the default UI mode.

## Build

```bash
pio run -e esp32_ext_mcp2515
```

Replace `esp32_ext_mcp2515` with the environment you are targeting.

## Flash

```bash
pio run -e esp32_ext_mcp2515 -t upload
```

For boards that need a different upload path or boot mode, use the normal PlatformIO upload flow for that board.

## First Boot

- ESP32 dashboard builds start their hotspot from `DASH_SSID` / `DASH_PASS`
- Open `http://100.100.1.1/` after connecting to the hotspot
- Change hotspot and OTA credentials after first boot
- Use the `WiFi Internet` card if you want plugin downloads or OTA updates from GitHub releases
- Use the `CAN Pins` card only on TWAI-based boards when you need non-default GPIO assignments

## Build Outputs

- RP2040 builds produce a `firmware.uf2`
- ESP32 and ATSAME51 builds produce a `firmware.bin`
- Manual dashboard OTA expects a `.bin` built for the exact target board
